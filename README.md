## 📌 About the Project

This mini-site pays tribute to **Satoru Gojo**, using a fullscreen **frame-by-frame scroll animation**, similar to what Rockstar did for GTA VI — except this time, it’s Gojo — because, well… it’s Gojo.

It was built as a learning project to explore scroll animations and cinematic storytelling in the browser.
